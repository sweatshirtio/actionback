actionback
==========

`Action Pack` now has **BACK!**

Deserialize URLs to resources or resource IDs.  Action Back uses your defined routes and controllers to determine the correct resource to return.  This is great for `Hypermedia APIs` and following [HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) principles in your REST APIs.

You can override the default behavior by implementing your own fetch method.
